# Gender and Brexit Discourse on Twitter
## Introduction
Since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, much research has focused on what factors led people to vote Leave, ranging from voters' economic position to their level of trust in institutions. Yet researchers have more recently pointed out that gender has largely been left to the side when we talk about Brexit, both in academic contexts and in general. This is in part because, at an aggregate level, men and women didn't show significant differences in voting Leave or Remain - looking at the British Election Study Internet Panel, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportions voting for/against Brexit <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>. At the same time, analysis of the campaigning for the referendum and subsequent debate has show that, whilst issues relating to women's rights and labour market participation did come up, gender was not on the agenda <sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>.
Yet at the same time, Brexit has some very gendered aspects. Those leading the call to leave the EU were predominantly men, and in the lead up to the vote the media coverage was dominated by men on both sides of the campaign, with 82.5% of the voices included in print and broadcast media being those of men <sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>.
 
## A quick look at the data
The data we are going to be analysing consists of 157,512 tweets that used the hashtag #Brexit during the period from the 29th January to 4th February 2020. Of these, 44,235 were original tweets, rather than retweets. For most of the analysis we exclude retweets, in order to avoid widely shared tweets being overly influential in the results.

The chart below how the tweets were distributed over the week. It's important to note here that the dataset is a sample of the tweets using #Brexit, rather than all tweets with that hashtag. So in the chart below, we're more interested in the relative distribution as opposed to the actual number of tweet. Not surprisingly, we see higher volumes on the day the UK left and the morning after, with a notable spike around 11pm on the 31st January - the official moment of departure.

Another point to note, before we delve into the analysis, is that Twitter does not provide details of how it samples tweets when you conduct a search on its platform, so it is not guaranteed that it is a completely random sample. We were able to specify, however, that our sample focus on tweets from users in the UK (though tweets from elsewhere are also included).
