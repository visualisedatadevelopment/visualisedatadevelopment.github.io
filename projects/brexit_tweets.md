# Gender and Brexit Discourse on Twitter
In the campaign leading up to the EU referendum in 2016, and the subsequent years of debate, the politics of Brexit has been about many things, from sovereignty to regulations, public trust in institutions and immigration. Yet one thing has largely been left off the agenda - gender.

Although issues such as EU legislation on women's employment rights have come up at times, they were [never central to the debate](https://ecpr.eu/Events/PaperDetails.aspx?PaperID=33436&EventID=114). The fact that there was no significant difference in the proportions of men and women voting Leave/Remain (according to [British Election Study data](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-objects/panel-study-data/)) has also led [some to argue](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-brexit-women/is-brexit-good-or-bad-for-women-its-divisive-to-even-ask-idUSKCN1RH162) that gender is irrelevant to Brexit. But at the same time, public discussion of Brexit has had a very gendered nature. The call for leaving the EU was largely led by male figures (including the "Bad Boys of Brexit"), but also, [a study](https://blog.lboro.ac.uk/crcc/eu-referendum/gender-balance-eu-referendum-coverage/) from 2016 estimated that 82.5% of the voices, on either side of the debate, included in media coverage of the campaign were male. And more recently, [researchers are finding](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3429689) that attitudes towards gender roles and perceived discrimination against men played a part in the Leave vote.

So how is gender reflected in popular discourse on Brexit? One place to analyse this is Twitter, which has been a hotpsot of public debate on the issue. When Britain officially left the EU on the 31st January 2020, there was significant activity around the #Brexit hashtag on the platform, and so here we're going to look at a dataset of #Brexit tweets from that week in order to look at how men and women were talked about in relation to leaving the EU. How much are men and women discussed, is it in the same way, and what topics are people talking about in reference to different genders? 

## A quick look at the data
The data we are going to be analysing consists of 157,512 tweets that used the hashtag #Brexit during the period from the 29th January to 4th February 2020. Of these, 44,235 were original tweets, rather than retweets. For most of the analysis we exclude retweets, in order to avoid widely shared tweets being overly influential in the results.

The chart below shows how the tweets were distributed over the week. It's important to note here that the dataset is a sample of the tweets using #Brexit, rather than all tweets with that hashtag. So in the chart below, we're more interested in the relative distribution as opposed to the absolute number of tweets. Not surprisingly, we see higher volumes on the day the UK left and the morning after, with a notable spike around 11pm on the 31st January - the official moment of departure.

Before delving into the analysist is always worth bearing in mind when looking at Twitter data that the tweeting population differs from the general UK population in terms of their demographics and political attitudes <sup>[5](#fn5)</sup>, though this does not mean that it's not a useful artefact of public discourse.
