# Gender and Brexit Discourse on Twitter
## Introduction
Introduction
## A quick look at the data
The data we are going to be analysing consists of 157,512 tweets that used the hashtag #Brexit during the period from the 29th January to 4th February 2020. Of these, 44,235 were original tweets, rather than retweets. For most of the analysis we exclude retweets, in order to avoid widely shared tweets being overly influential in the results.

The chart below how the tweets were distributed over the week. It's important to note here that the dataset is a sample of the tweets using #Brexit, rather than all tweets with that hashtag. So in the chart below, we're more interested in the relative distribution as opposed to the actual number of tweet. Not surprisingly, we see higher volumes on the day the UK left and the morning after, with a notable spike around 11pm on the 31st January - the official moment of departure.

It is important to note here that the dataset is a sample of the tweets that used #Brexit, rather than all tweets with that hashtag. Twitter does not provide details of how it samples tweets when you conduct a search on its platform, so it is not guaranteed that it is a completely random sample. We were able to specify, however, that our sample focus on tweets from users in the UK (though tweets from elsewhere are also included).
